# YouTube Replica

## Project Overview
This project is a simple web application mimicking the user interface of YouTube. Using Tailwind CSS for styling and a straightforward HTML structure, this application showcases various components such as a header, sidebar, and a grid of video cards that represent video thumbnails. It's designed to serve as a basic template for further development or educational purposes.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-replica.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-replica
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser** to view the application:
   ```bash
   open index.html  # Use 'xdg-open index.html' on Linux or 'start index.html' on Windows
   ```

You do not need any additional dependencies to run this project, as it primarily relies on CDN links for CSS frameworks and icons.

## Usage
Once the project is opened in your browser, you will see a layout that includes:

- A **header** with a search bar and user actions (Sign in, Notifications, etc.).
- A **sidebar** with navigation links (Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, History).
- A **main area** displaying video thumbnails along with their titles, channel names, and other details.

You can modify the HTML to add more functionality, such as linking the buttons or dynamically loading video content.

## Features
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Customizable styling through `styles.css`.
- Structure reminiscent of the YouTube interface.
- Placeholder video cards that can be updated with real data.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following external resources:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icon usage in the application interface.
- **Google Fonts**: For the Roboto font.

You can access them directly in the `index.html` file via CDN links.
